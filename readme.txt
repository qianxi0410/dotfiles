some dotfiles used by myself.

all dotfiles are managed by chezmoi(https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).
it's so f***ing awesome.

if you want to use my dotfiles as a template, you can use the following command:
    chezmoi init https://github.com/qianxi0410/dotfiles.git
    chezmoi apply -v

that's all.
